# Exercise: Cthulhu

## Cthulhu.jl

[Cthulhu.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDebug/Cthulhu.jl) is an interactive, more powerful generalization of the introspection macros. Among other things it has the following features:

* Allows easy switching between code representations (syntax, typed, native, ...).
* **Recursive application possible**(!) (i.e. introspecting a function that is called within a function within function ...).

## Exercise

In this exercise, you will make yourself familiar with the basics of [Cthulhu.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDebug/Cthulhu.jl), a tool to interactively introspect Julia code.

**Note:**
* **Cthulhu only works in the REPL and not in Jupyter! Hence, you must do this exercise in a Terminal!**
* Please run `julia --project` to start Julia REPL!

## Part I: Introspection basics

Consider the following Julia code:
```julia
function mysum(x)
    s = zero(eltype(x))
    for xi in x
        s += xi
    end
    return s
end

function entryfunc(x)
    if all(i->i>0, x)
        return mysum(x)
    else
        return mysum(abs.(x))
    end
end
```

1. Load Cthulhu (`using Cthulhu`) and use `@descend entryfunc(rand(3))` to start the analysis.

The output that you see is structured as follows:
* First, it shows the name of the current function and its source code location (`REPL[i]:j` if the function is defined in the REPL instead of a file).
* Second, it displays the source code of the function which, by default, is augmented with type information (from Julia's type inference).
* Third, it shows you modes/options that you can toggle.
* Lastly, it shows you a list of possible function calls within the current function.

For the last point above, it is important to note: **Cthulhu doesn't run your code and therefore has no runtime information but only static (type) information.** It doesn't know if the given x fulfills the if-condition or not. (Contrast this to a regular debugger.)

2. Press `t` on your keyboard to toggle the type annotations in the source code.

3. Let's now switch between different code representations. Type `N` (i.e. press `SHIFT+n`) to switch to native code. Afterwards, type `L` (i.e. `SHIFT+l`) to get the LLVM IR. Finally, type `S` (i.e. `SHIFT+s`) to get back to the source code level.

4. Assume you actually want to investigate the native code for the `mysum` function in the first branch (where all elements of `x` are positive). Use the up-/down-arrow keys to select `mysum(x)` (or `mysum(x::Vector{Float64})` if type annotations are active) in the list at the bottom (the dot on the left indicates the currently selected call) and press `ENTER` to step one level down. On the new level, switch to native code representation.

5. Optional/Bonus: See how the native code changes for integer input, i.e. `rand(Int, 3)`. Can you relate this to SIMD vectorization (if you already know what that means)?

If you're done with this part, **you can exit Cthulhu by pressing `q`.**

## Part II: Code path traversal

We've seen above that, for a given entry point (i.e. function call) Cthulhu allows us to interactively traverse the underlying code paths. This is particularly useful to understand and navigate unfamiliar code bases.

### Example 1: `all`
1. For the example code given above (Part I), navigate into the `all` function call.

What you see might look strange: The source code seems incomplete. However, note that Cthulhu gives us a hint (Info note) what we should do:
```
[ Info: This method only fills in default arguments; descend into the body method to see the full source.
```
2. Do as Cthulhu says and navigate down one level (into `#all#...`).

Now we see complete source code but it is not very informative as it only redirects to another function `_all(...)`.

3. Step down further (i.e. into `_all(...)`).

We finally see the actual meaningful implementation of the `all` operation.

### Example 2: BLAS/LAPACK calls

For most linear algebra operations Julia uses BLAS/LAPACK under the hood. However, don't take my word for it but figure it out yourself ðŸ˜„

1. Use Cthulhu to descend into a matrix-matrix multiplication (i.e. `@descend rand(5,5) * rand(5,5)`) and try to traverse down to the underlying BLAS/LAPACK call. (Hint: focus on `mul!` calls)
    * Additional: Does Julia always call BLAS/LAPACK or can you see a branch in the source code that leads to a pure-Julia implementation? If so, where is it defined?

## Part III: Recursive `@code_warntype` (Bonus)

**Note that this is a bonus part in which we anticipate content from tomorrow.**

Cthulhu is a very helpful tool to locate type inference issues, especially if they happen deep inside of your code rather than at the top-level. Essentially, you can use it like `@code_warntype` but interactively and recursively.

Consider this variation of the example above:

```julia
function myfunc(x)
    s = zero(eltype(x))
    for xi in x
        tmp = rand(["hello", xi, false])
        if tmp isa String
            s += 0
        else
            s += tmp
        end
    end
    return s::Float64
end

function entryfunc2(x)
    if all(i->i>0, x)
        return myfunc(x)
    else
        return myfunc(abs.(x))
    end
end
```

1. Use Cthulhu to figure out if `entryfunc2(rand(3))` has type inference issues.
    * Hint: Make sure to activate type annotations in source code mode (`t`) or switch to the typed code representation (`T`). Then, activate the warn option (`w`) to highlight problematic occurrences in red/orange.

2. Next, step one level down into the `myfunc` function. Does this function have type inference issues?
