# Exercise: Distributed Monte Carlo (MPI)
#
# Calculate the value of π through parallel direct Monte Carlo.
#
# A unit circle is inscribed inside a unit square with side length 2 (from -1 to 1).
# The area of the circle is π, the area of the square is 4, and the ratio is π/4.
# This means that, if you throw N darts randomly at the square, approximately M=Nπ/4
# of those darts will land inside the unit circle.
#
# Throw darts randomly at a unit square and count how many of them ($M$) landed inside
# the unit circle. Approximate π ≈ 4M/N.
#
#
# ------ Tasks -------
#
# Based on the serial `compute_pi` (see below) we want to write a MPI program that computes π
# in parallel. The total number of dart throws is supposed to be (equally) distributed among
# the available MPI ranks (i.e. each rank runs `compute_pi` for a certain `N_local`)
#
# 1. Implement the parts marked by TODO below.
#
# 2. Run the code with the following command:
#
#                    mpiexecjl --project -n 4 julia mc_mpi.jl
#
#    How does the performance of the MPI code compare to the Distributed.jl variant?

function compute_pi(N)
    M = 0 # number of darts that landed in the circle
    for i in 1:N
        if sqrt(rand()^2 + rand()^2) < 1.0
            M += 1
        end
    end
    return 4 * M / N
end
