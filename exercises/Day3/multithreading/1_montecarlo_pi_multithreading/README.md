# Exercises: Sampling π with Monte Carlo

In these exercises you will **parallelize a simple Monte Carlo algorithm** that can produce the value of π=3.141... with desirable precision. Specifically, you will parallelize the algorithm using **multithreading** (`Base.Threads`).

Outlook: Tomorrow you will parallelize the same algorithm using (distributed) **multiprocessing** (Distributed.jl/MPI.jl).
